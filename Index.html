   	<H2>My Name is Brady Voelker</H2>   		

<P style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Courier New">I am  16 and I am huge into technology.
Programing for me is what I would love to do when I get older and create software and apps. 
I'm glad to start learning more. I know how to do most stuff people get confused on too. I have programed a Lock 
screen for my iPhone before in fact I was just using it. I am also a Boy Scout which I love doing. It really 
teaches you a lot of skills you need to learn in life. I play golf in the summer/fall and I play tennis in the 
spring. I have 3 older brothers, One is a senior in college and the other is a junior in college. My other brother
is a senior in High school and I am a junior.

	<P style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Courier New">What a beautiful Sunday it was out in 
	Winchester today. I was hoping that it wouldn't be freezing like it was in the past. It was 
	just the perfect temperature not to hot or cold. An amazing day for the SU baseball picnic 
	and some great baseball! It wasn't against any other college team just a day for fun. My 
	brother Caleb was able to get out there and play ball. He had some great hits. Caleb can
	smash that ball with a great hit! He sure got down and dirty. It was a great day to spend with the family!</p>
