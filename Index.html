<P style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Courier New">I am  16 and I am huge into technology.
Programing for me is what I would love to do when I get older and create software and apps. 
I'm glad to start learning more. I know how to do most stuff people get confused on too. I have programed a Lock 
screen for my iPhone before in fact I was just using it. I am also a Boy Scout which I love doing. It really 
teaches you a lot of skills you need to learn in life. I play golf in the summer/fall and I play tennis in the 
spring. I have 3 older brothers, One is a senior in college and the other is a junior in college. My other brother
is a senior in High school and I am a junior.

	winchester today. I was hopeing that it woldnt be freezing like in the past and it wasnt. It was 
	just the perfectect tempeture not to hot or cold. A amazing day for the SU baseball picnic 
	and some great baseball! It wasnt against any other college team just a day for fun. My 
	brother calleb was finally able to get out there and play he had some great hits. Caleb can
	smash that ball with a great hit! He sure got down and dirty.<p>
