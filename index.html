	<span class='font'>The weather today could of turned out so cold today considering its November. What beautiful weather it was with an amazing 69 
	Degrees outside. It was so gorgeous outside today and made it such an amazing hike. My brother, I and our great friend Uncle Ben had such an amazing time hiking today. We were mainly 
	just doing it for the cooking merit badge with Boy Scouts but also to see him. We decided to go to Prince William Forest park today as it's a great 
	choice because it's close and has great wildlife and scenery to see.</span><br><br>
	
	<span class='font'>The trail we were going to go on was 3.1 miles but we just did a big loop and instead we did 6.5 miles. We had breakfast at the picnic 
	tables near the visitor center with bagels, bananas and grapes. The trees were so beautiful! After a few miles we stopped at the middle of the loop 
	to have lunch. Spencer and I had some mountain house chicken and rice as uncle ben had trail tacos. I'll have to try them someday!! Also that's where
	we got to make some alcohol stoves and had some delicious food. Making the stoves was a great experience. With the alcohol stoves we just made, it 
	took about fifteen minutes to boil a cup of water compared to using his real stove just taking two minutes to boil two cups of water. If you're 
	stuck in a survival situation it's a great lightweight alternative but if I had the choice I wouldn't rely on it If I didn't need too. I loved 
	stopping at the small little waterfall near the bottom of this huge hill where Uncle Ben got some water and filtered it. Spencer tried it too. Doing
	the 6.5 miles was perfect as it just meant more time to hang with Uncle Ben as we don't normally see each other a lot. He's such a cool and great guy
	to know. I also got to make, learn and use an alcohol stove which just adds to the experience. I'm looking forward to possibly doing it again just a
	different trail maybe we will go to Shenandoah national park next if we do plan another hike. Check out his <a href="http://www.blogbyben.com/2015/11/hiking-and-eating-for-good-cause.html" target="_blank">Blog.</a></span></div>

	<span class='font'>First trip of this year with Cteen and it was just so much fun 2015-2016. Rabbi chooses for us to go to a ropes course and I'm so
	glad he did. It was extremely worth it and even better was that we went at night so everything was lit up. The only bad thing with going at night was
	taking pictures. I did manage to slip but that's why you are attached to a wire 15 feet up in the air up to maybe 70 feet with one course you could 
	go on. We went to <a href="http://sandyspringadventurepark.org/" target="_blank">Sandy Springs</a> Adventure Park but what we did was the Twilight 
        ropes course. sorry for the bad quality.</span></div>

	<span class='font'>As some people really love trampolines, I really do. My brother spencer 
	got a job at <a href="http://www.skyzone.com/manassas/" target="_blank">Sky Zone</a> and it's 
	an amazing trampoline place! Today <a href="http://www.skyzone.com/manassas/" target="_blank">Sky Zone</a> 
	was doing a soft opening so that friends and family of the workers were able to go and jump for free. 
	I am so happy I did it too as it was so much fun. For me it's a lot better than rebounders as they 
	have dodgeball! My brother and I got my mom to jump and it was great. I'm just glad we got my 
	mom to jump that was the most fun. She went to jump into the foam pit and got stuck but I have 
	to admit it is difficult to get out of. I know my mom isn't the first though. When she got stuck 
	I snuck and grabbed her phone and took a picture. I would totally go there anytime if could.

	<span class='font'>What a beautiful Sunday it was out in Winchester today. I was hoping that it wouldn't be freezing like 
	it was in the past. It was just the perfect temperature not to hot or cold. An amazing day for the SU baseball picnic 
	and some great baseball! It wasn't against any other college team just a day for fun. My brother Caleb was able to get out
	there and play ball. He had some great hits. Caleb can smash that ball with a great hit! He sure got down and dirty. It was
	a great day to spend with the family!</span>
