	<span class='font'>I am  16 and I am huge into technology.
	Programing for me is what I would love to do when I get older and create software and apps. 
	I'm glad to start learning more. I know how to do most stuff people get confused on too. I have programed a Lock 
	screen for my iPhone before in fact I was just using it. I am also a Boy Scout which I love doing. It really 
	teaches you a lot of skills you need to learn in life. I play golf in the summer/fall and I play tennis in the 
	spring. I have 3 older brothers, One is a senior in college and the other is a junior in college. My other brother
	is a senior in High school and I am a junior.</span>

	<span class='font'>As some people really love trampolines, I really do. My brother spencer 
	got a job at <a href="http://www.skyzone.com/manassas/"target="_blank">Sky Zone</a> and it's 
	an amazing trampoline place! Today <a href="http://www.skyzone.com/manassas/"target="_blank">Sky Zone</a> 
	was doing a soft opening so that friends and family of the workers were able to go and jump for free. 
	I am so happy I did it too as it was so much fun. For me it's a lot better than rebounders as they 
	have dodgeball! My brother and I got my mom to jump and it was great. I'm just glad we got my 
	mom to jump that was the most fun. She went to jump into the foam pit and got stuck but I have 
	to admit it is difficult to get out of. I know my mom isn't the first though. When she got stuck 
	I snuck and grabbed her phone and took a picture. I would totally go there anytime if could.</span>

	<span class='font'>What a beautiful Sunday it was out in Winchester today. I was hoping that it wouldn't be freezing like 
	it was in the past. It was just the perfect temperature not to hot or cold. An amazing day for the SU baseball picnic 
	and some great baseball! It wasn't against any other college team just a day for fun. My brother Caleb was able to get out
	there and play ball. He had some great hits. Caleb can smash that ball with a great hit! He sure got down and dirty. It was
	a great day to spend with the family!</span>
